Adapting to Rising Tides: Nicolas Sander & Todd Hallenbeck
July 13th, 2020

The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission Adapting to Rising Tides Program developed a dataset to better understand community vulnerability to current and future flooding due to sea level rise and storm surges. This data has been used in the Adapting To Rising Tides Bay Area Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Assessment project as well as helping inform the implementation of the BCDC Environmental Justice and Social Equity Bay Plan amendment. This document provides more in-depth information about the data inputs and methodology that was used as well as information about how to access the data.
