July 13th, 2020 (Updated January, 16, 2024)

The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission Adapting to Rising Tides Program developed a dataset to better understand community vulnerability to current and future flooding due to sea level rise and storm surges. This data has been used in the Adapting To Rising Tides Bay Area Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Assessment project as well as helping inform the implementation of the BCDC Environmental Justice and Social Equity Bay Plan amendment. This document provides more in-depth information about the data inputs and methodology that was used as well as information about how to access the data. To learn more about the creation of this dataset and an interactive viewer, please see <https://www.bcdc.ca.gov/data/community.html>. For additional descriptions of GIS methods used in ART Bay Area, please see the ART Bay Area Report Appendix: GIS Data and Methods. For more information, please contact <GIS@bcdc.ca.gov>.

Manual Work that occurred after the script was run (and should be incoporated into the next iteration) includes:
Correct the combined_vulnerabilty category terms (Social and Contamination, Social, Contamination, Low, Not Calculated)
Create field alias for combined_vulnerabilty
Updated symbology based new categories
Calculate field as "None" for List of indicators (social/contamination) that are blank (ie. count = 0)
Update or remove the SLR intersection data
